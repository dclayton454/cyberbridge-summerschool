üïµÔ∏è Threat Actor Profile: APT-GonePhishing
Overview:
APT-GonePhishing is a cyber-espionage group notorious for its deeply engineered social engineering campaigns. Active since 2017, this group specializes in long-term phishing operations tailored to compromise executives, diplomatic staff, and key personnel in supply chain management roles. Their strength lies in highly believable phishing lures combined with multi-phase attack chains. Believed to operate out of Eastern Europe, APT-GonePhishing focuses on sectors such as government, finance, defense contracting, and maritime logistics.

Motivation:
Primarily espionage and strategic intelligence gathering, though occasional signs of financial gain via secondary monetization (e.g., ransomware deployment) have been noted.

Unique Characteristics:

Employs linguistically localized lures with regional dialects and cultural references.

Often creates entire fake companies or NGOs to support phishing infrastructure.

Frequently abuses legitimate marketing platforms (Mailchimp, Brevo, SendGrid) to distribute payloads.

Known for stealthy lateral movement using browser cookie theft and OAuth token abuse.
